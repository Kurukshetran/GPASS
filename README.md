"Google Play App Store Spider"

This repository contains a project built for Professor Grinstein's "Visual Analytics" class (91.540 Spring 2014 semester) at UMass Lowell. The project's purpose was to create a visualization of the Google Play App Store. 

There is the source code for the GPASS application under the javasrc/ folder. 
The libraries used (HyperSQL http://hsqldb.org/) can be found under lib/. 
There is an output in CSV format under extras/. This output contains 405,709 unique rows resulting from running the GPASS application for ~3 days. There is a performance issue when running the program for this long; suspected database limitation.
The PowerPoint used to present the project to the class can also be found under extras/.
